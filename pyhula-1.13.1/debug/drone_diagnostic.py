Why commands return False:
=========================

1. "Takeoff not finish" + False:
   - Drone is already flying
   - Takeoff conditions not met
   - Command sent but couldn't execute

2. "Forward not finish" + False:
   - Drone is not flying (need takeoff first)
   - Obstacle detected
   - Command sent but movement blocked

3. Normal Command Sequence:
   ✓ Connect to drone
   ✓ Check drone is on ground
   ✓ Send takeoff command
   ✓ Wait for takeoff completion
   ✓ Send movement commands
   ✓ Send landing command

4. Safety Features:
   - Commands are sent to drone regardless
   - Drone decides whether to execute
   - False return = "command acknowledged but not executed"
   - This prevents dangerous operations
